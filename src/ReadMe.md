<H1>The One - A Home Automation System Simulation</H1>

### 1. Goal
*To simulate a home automation system using threads and events patterns.*

### 2. System Requirements
1. Monitoring (e.g What is the temp, is door locked, are lights on.)
2. Control (e.g Turn up the heating, Lock the Door, Turn Light on or off.)
3. Automation (e.g Turn on the heating if the outside temperature falls below a certain temperature.)


##### 2.1 System Components
1. Door Locks: Can lock or unlock based on command.
2. Lights: Can turn on or off based on command.
3. AC: Can turn on or off & change temperature based on command.
4. Sensors: Does a singular task depending on type, e.g motion sensors turn on if someone is in the room
5. Outdoor Camera. Sends Live video or picture depicting the state of its surroundings.


#####2.2 User Requirements
An interactive GUI that displays the live state of each system components and allows the user to interact with each system components
